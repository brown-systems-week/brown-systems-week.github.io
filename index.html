            <p>
              The Systems Week is a five-day seminar on the principles and practice of software systems. 
              Its goal is to prepare a cohort of 20–25 participants for cutting-edge research in the area of 
              systems. Yearly topics combine recurring systems themes, combined with each year's special theme 
              driven by broader trends in the field. Each topic is co-taught by a faculty pair with combined 
              expertise on the subject, offering a chance to study a problem from multiple complementary 
              perspectives. A key goal of the seminar is to foster collaborations between faculty and students 
              that far exceed the seminar's timeline, ideally into the rest of the summer and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
              A typical Systems Week will include five mini-courses, delivered in daily lectures from multiple faculty members. 
              Example topics include automated parallelization and distribution, retrofitting privacy guarantees, automated 
              reasoning for systems, and scalable dataflow and streaming systems. The target audience includes advanced 
              undergraduate or early PhD students with a serious (and broad) background in systems, but not necessarily on 
              any of the seminar's theme topics. An anticipated set of prerequisites and prior knowledge will be made 
              available several weeks prior to the seminar.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Week's first edition will include a smaller cohort and possibly a small set of courses.

                  Lectures and corresponding lab sessions fall under (1) a common systems core, 
                  and (2) each year's special theme, driven by broader trends in the field. 
                  Lectures are provided by a combination of systems faculty at Brown CS 
                  and guest faculty from other institutions. The Systems Week additionally 
                  includes ample opportunities for interaction with industry participants 
                  and several additional social activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Systems Week is organized around five mini-courses, typically delivered in daily lectures

                  retrofitting privacy guarantees, automated reasoning for systems, and scalable dataflow and 
                  streaming systems.

            <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Organization &amp; Schedule</h2>
            <p>
              The sessions are non-overlapping, so all participants will have the opportunity to attend all lectures. 
              Each lecture is 80 minutes, including Q&amp;A, and each topic comprises a total of 4 lectures 
              totalling 320 minutes and spread throughout the week. Most lectures will be given between 9am to 5pm 
              during weekdays, during the following windows: Session A (9–10:20am), B (10:40am–noon), C (2–3:20pm), 
              and D (3:40–5pm). Courses will include hacking sessions, with ample opportunities for interactivity, 
              and in-class assignments optionally to be completed at home. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Background sessions might be offered the weekend preceding the Systems Week and, depending on 
              participant and faculty interest, targeted research opportunities may be explored the weekend 
              following the Systems Week.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following is a sample schedule. Lectures and hacking sessions take place in spaces of the Watson Center 
              for Information Technology (CIT) and the Brown Data Science Institute (DSI).

              Attendees have all of their living expenses covered—e.g., accommodation, 
              food, and transportation to various activities—and should be able to engage 
              meaningfully in research soon after the start of the seminar. Attendees 
              are expected to attend all lectures during the day, with limited homework 
              (1–2h) in the evening. Outside lectures and homework, the seminar combines 
              research-oriented activities (e.g., a "Research Highlights" reception) 
              with social activities (e.g., art nights, hikes around Providence) 
              and other organized events.
